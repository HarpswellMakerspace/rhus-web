						            Wildflowers of Detroit is a community project built to raise awareness of the budding ecology in Detroit's many "vacant" lots and to track their growth over time. As the city continues to cycle through new eras, we present the Wildflowers of Detroit project as the plants voice. (a tool to more closely track the needs of plants - resource management?? resource awareness?).<bre/>

												            The technological side of this project is composed of mobile apps, geolocation tagging, and a timeline. Each app is a camera, gelocation map, and personal image gallery.  Download and take it into the open fields. Use the apps and the website to upload images, see what other users are finding, and watch the changes in fields over time.<br/>

																		           <br/>																								
					Here are three ways you can Get Involved:<br/>
					<br/>
					1) Download the Wild Detroit application on your Android(link) or iPhone(link) and start taking pictures!<br/>
					<br/>
					2) Submit a request to add backdated images by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@wildflowersofdetroit.org">WinterRoot</a><br/>
					<br/>
					3) Subscribe to our <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a>, RSS, or <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> feeds<br/>

						This project has been developed by WinterRoot using our open source technology called Rhus. It's primary purpose is to (interest missions statement here), but as an open source project it will be available for all interested collaborators to branch and develop in accordance with their own inspiration!
